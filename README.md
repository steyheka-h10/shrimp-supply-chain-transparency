# Shrimp Supply Chain Transparency Advocacy Hub

## Mission Statement

This project aims to advocate for the enforcement of U.S. laws, specifically the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP), to prevent shrimp produced with forced labor, child labor, or forced child labor from entering the U.S. market. We are committed to raising awareness, educating consumers and purchasers about the risks associated with purchasing shrimp from unethical supply chains, and pushing for meaningful regulatory action to eliminate forced labor from global seafood supply chains.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from advocates, researchers, legal experts, consumers, and anyone concerned about human rights in the seafood industry. Here are ways you can get involved:

1. **Submit Educational Resources:** Share articles, reports, infographics, or other materials that help explain forced labor in the fishing industry and how consumers can make ethical purchasing decisions.

2. **Report Suspected Supply Chain Issues:** If you have information about specific shrimp suppliers, importers, or supply chains that may be using forced or child labor, you can submit a tip (see our Issue Template for Supply Chain Tips).

3. **Improve Documentation:** Help us expand and improve our resource lists, FAQs, and other documents by opening pull requests or suggesting edits.

4. **Spread Awareness:** Share this repository and its resources with your networks, and use the information to advocate for stronger enforcement of existing laws.

To contribute, please:
- Open an Issue to discuss your proposed contribution.
- Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a Pull Request.
- Review existing Issues and help with tasks that need completion.

Together we can help ensure that the shrimp on our plates is not tainted by human suffering.
