# U.S. Laws and Regulations Relevant to Forced Labor in Seafood

This document lists key U.S. laws and regulations that can be used to prevent the import of shrimp (and other seafood) produced with forced labor, child labor, or forced child labor.

## 1. Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1307)

**Section 307** of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced labor, including forced child labor. This law has been used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to issue Withhold Release Orders (WROs) and Findings against specific shipments or entities suspected of using forced labor.

- **Official Text:** [19 U.S.C. § 1307](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1307)
- **Key Provisions:** 
  - Allows CBP to detain, exclude, or seize shipments where forced labor is suspected.
  - Places the burden of proof on importers to demonstrate that their goods are not made with forced labor.
  - Applies to all merchandise, including seafood.

## 2. Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP)

The **Seafood Import Monitoring Program** is a risk‑based traceability program implemented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the authority of the Magnuson‑Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. SIMP requires importers to provide and maintain data about the harvest, landing, and chain of custody of certain seafood products, including shrimp, to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and seafood fraud. Although SIMP does not explicitly target forced labor, improved traceability can help identify high‑risk supply chains and support enforcement of forced‑labor prohibitions.

- **Key Provisions:**
  - Requires harvest and landing data for covered species (including shrimp).
  - Mandates that importers keep records for up to two years and make them available upon request.
  - Creates a foundation for future expansion to include labor‑rights criteria.

## 3. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA)

The **Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act** (Pub.L. 117–78) establishes a rebuttable presumption that any goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, or by entities identified on the UFLPA Entity List, are made with forced labor and therefore prohibited from importation into the United States. While focused on Xinjiang, the law reinforces the U.S. government’s commitment to blocking forced‑labor goods from any region.

- **Official Text:** [UFLPA Public Law 117-78](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ78/PLAW-117publ78.pdf)
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Presumes goods from Xinjiang are made with forced labor unless the importer can prove otherwise.
  - Requires CBP to apply the presumption to all shipments that may have any link to Xinjiang.
  - Applies to all commodities, including seafood and shrimp.

## 4. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 22.17 – Combating Trafficking in Persons

This regulation requires federal contractors and subcontractors to maintain policies and procedures that prohibit trafficking in persons, including forced labor, and to take appropriate action against employees who violate such policies. While not a trade law, it influences the supply chains of companies that sell seafood to the U.S. government.

- **Official Text:** [FAR 52.222-50](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.222-50)
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Prohibits contractors from engaging in severe forms of trafficking in persons.
  - Requires contractors to monitor subcontractors and recruiters.
  - Provides for termination and other penalties for violations.

## How These Laws Can Be Used Together

Enforcement of the Tariff Act’s forced‑labor prohibition, combined with SIMP’s traceability data, can create a powerful mechanism to keep shrimp produced with forced labor out of the U.S. market. Advocates can:
- Petition CBP to issue Withhold Release Orders for shrimp from specific regions or producers.
- Use SIMP data to map supply chains and identify high‑risk importers.
- Encourage NOAA and CBP to coordinate enforcement efforts and expand SIMP to include explicit labor‑rights criteria.
